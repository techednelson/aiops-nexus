----

**AIOps-Nexus** is an open-source, **dockerized application** that simplifies IT operations by analyzing logs from monitoring tools like **OpenSearch**, **Elasticsearch**, **Alertmanager**, **Prometheus**, and more. Using free, open-source LLMs, it identifies root causes of issues and generates actionable solutions.

Deployable within your corporate infrastructure (e.g., inside a VPN) or on cloud VMs with controlled access, AIOps-Nexus ensures your data remains secure and never exposed to the internet. This makes it ideal for organizations prioritizing privacy while leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiency with **minimal costs**, limited to the hardware or VM where it is deployed.

---

## Key Features

- **[Dynamic LLM Selection](https://ollama.com/search)**: Choose from various open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, DeepSeek-R1, and more via Ollama) to meet specific user needs.
- **Free and Open Source**: Utilize completely free, open-source LLM models without incurring API costsâ€”your only expense is the hardware or VM where the app is deployed.
- **Log Analysis**: Automatically analyze logs from monitoring tools to identify root causes of incidents.
- **Actionable Solutions**: Generate and deliver solutions via webhooks to platforms like Slack and Discord for team awareness and collaboration.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Optimize performance by caching repeated queries for faster responses.

## Why Use AIOps-Nexus?

**AIOps-Nexus** enables companies and users to integrate AI into their operations effortlessly, supporting incident resolution and operational efficiency at no additional cost beyond infrastructure. By combining cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly interface, this project empowers teams to focus on solving problems rather than managing tools.
